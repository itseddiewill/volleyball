<ul class="marker:text-textOff list-disc pl-8">
<li><strong>Snug fit:</strong>&nbsp;Your shoe should feel secure without being too tight. There should be minimal wiggle room to prevent injuries.</li>
<li><strong>Toe space:</strong>&nbsp;Ensure there&rsquo;s about a finger width of space between your toes and the tip of the shoe to allow natural movement.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong>&nbsp;The shoe should bend naturally at the ball of your foot without restriction, allowing for smooth movements during play.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="mb-2 mt-6 text-lg first:mt-3">5. Breathability</h2>
